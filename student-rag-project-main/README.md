# RAG Learning App

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Python, ChromaDB, SentenceTransformers, and Google Gemini. You'll build this incrementally over Weeks 10–15.

## What This App Does

You can ask this app questions about Python, machine learning, databases, APIs, and AI concepts. It finds the most relevant documents from its knowledge base and sends them to Gemini as context — so the answers are grounded in real information rather than guesswork.

## System Architecture

```
User Query
    │
    ▼
[security.py]      ← Validate and sanitize input (Week 12)
    │
    ▼
[workflow.py]      ← Rewrite query for better retrieval (Week 15)
    │
    ▼
[embeddings.py]    ← Convert query to a vector
    │
    ▼
[vector_store.py]  ← Find similar document vectors in ChromaDB
    │
    ▼
[filters.py]       ← Remove irrelevant results (Week 14)
    │
    ▼
[rag_pipeline.py]  ← Build prompt with retrieved context
    │
    ▼
  Gemini API       ← Generate answer
    │
    ▼
[monitoring.py]    ← Check for hallucinations (Week 13)
    │
    ▼
[app.py]           ← Display answer, sources, confidence
```

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd student-rag-project
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:
- **Mac/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
- **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up your Gemini API key

Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace `your-gemini-api-key-here` with your actual key.

### 5. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
